AnAI  - Ana, an interactable llmperson ai. AnAI for short.
---
  --

Main ideas/features:
--------------------
1) Traits and important memories are initially procedurally selected from a long database of options.
2) New interactions being moved to the active memory state should be scanned for "important memories". If deemed an important memory,
   the llmperson's important memories are updated with the new interaction details.
   Important details will have to be efficiently extracted.

Other ideas/features:
---------------------
1) Active emotional state dependent on traits and memory, used to meaningfully impact the llmperson response.
2) Optimized encoding for memories? How optimized can we get such that the LLM can still efficiently interpret it?

Long term goals:
----------------
1) Use personal traits to create a consistent-looking and interactable 3d model alongside response generation.
