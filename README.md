Say hello to Ana, an AI!

To introduce you to Ana, you need to be familiar with an "llmperson". An llmperson is my own proposed model, which connects LLMs to features one might associate an individual person with, such as emotional and personality traits, physical apperance, motivations, background, and memories. See this diagram for the full idea:



The goal of Ana is to successfully use this model to procedurally generate different, unique llmpersons.
