Say hello to Ana, an AI!

To introduce you to Ana, you need to be familiar with an "llmperson". 

![llmperson model](model/llmperson-proposal-model.png)

An llmperson is my own proposed model, which connects llms to features one might associate an individual person with, such as emotional and personality traits, physical apperance, motivations, background, and memories. The goal of Ana is to successfully implement this model and procedurally generate different, unique, interactable versions of Ana. 

Whether Ana decides to be a platonic friend, cold adversary, neutral observer, lover, etc is up to random chance and how the llm is feeling, much like a real person! It is up to you to explore and get to know her, to see how things pan out.
